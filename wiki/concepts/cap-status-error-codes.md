# Status & Error Codes

> The dual-layer status system: HTTP codes plus DataForSEO internal `status_code` values (20000 OK, 20100 Task Created, 40xxx client, 50xxx server) and which are retryable. Sits under [[index|DataForSEO Brain]] → [[concepts/_index|Concepts]].

## Overview
DataForSEO reports outcome at two layers: the HTTP response code and an internal `status_code` field that appears both at the response top level and per task. A request can be HTTP 200 yet carry a per-task error code, so robust clients must inspect both; for example, 40204 remains a defined "subscription required" code, but is legacy for Backlinks and LLM Mentions after their 2026-07-01 pay-as-you-go move. Codes group into success (200xx), client errors (40xxx), and server/3rd-party errors (50xxx). Knowing the retryable set is essential for reliable pipelines.

## What it covers
- HTTP codes: 401 Unauthorized, 402 Payment Required, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error.
- Success: 20000 "Ok." (request completed), 20100 "Task Created." (Standard task accepted).
- Task management (40000-40006): 40000 multiple tasks not allowed, 40006 >100 tasks per POST.
- Auth/verification (40100-40104): 40100 not authorized, 40102 no search results, 40103 task execution failed (resubmit), 40104 account verification required.
- Payment/account (40200-40210): 40200 insufficient balance, 40202 rate limit (2000/min), 40203 daily cost limit, 40204 subscription required (legacy for Backlinks and LLM Mentions after 2026-07-01), 40207 IP not whitelisted, 40209 >30 simultaneous, 40210 insufficient funds.
- Not found (40400-40408): 40401 task doesn't exist, 40403 "Results Expired" (data older than one month), 40404 sandbox missing prepared data, 40408 target URL invalid/404.
- Validation (40501-40506): 40501 invalid POST field, 40502 empty POST, 40503 invalid POST, 40506 unknown fields.
- Task status (40601 "Task Handed", 40602 "Task in Queue").
- Server (50xxx): 50000 internal error, 50301 3rd-party unavailable, 50303 update in progress, 50401 Live 120s timeout, 50402 target page 50s timeout.

## Key parameters / inputs
- Inspect `status_code` and `status_message` at both the envelope and per-task level.
- `tasks_error` counts tasks with errors in a batch response.

## Response / what you get back
- Live-observed task-level codes (2026-06-26, `_cost-log.json`): 40204 on Backlinks and LLM Mentions endpoints (then subscription-gated, $0 charged); 40501 on a malformed Labs `categories_for_domain` and a YouTube SERP call; 40402 on a Google Shopping products call (invalid URL path). Charged tasks all returned 20000.
- Timeline correction: Backlinks and LLM Mentions were gated through 2026-06-26, but DataForSEO removed the gate on 2026-07-01 when it moved all APIs to pay-as-you-go. Live re-probe on 2026-07-08 returned `20000 Ok` for `/v3/backlinks/summary/live`, `/v3/backlinks/bulk_ranks/live`, and `/v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/search/live`.
- A failed task returns `result_count: 0` and `cost: 0` - you are not billed for errored tasks.

## Cost & method notes
Errored tasks are not charged, so cost-control depends on not retrying non-retryable errors blindly. For Backlinks and LLM Mentions, 40204 is now a legacy signal from the former subscription gate; those modules are per-call pay-as-you-go as of 2026-07-01. See [[cap-account-usage-userdata]] and [[cap-queue-priority-cost-model]].

## When to use / how it fits
Build your retry/error matrix from this note before shipping [[play-cost-optimized-pipeline]] or [[play-rank-tracking-pipeline]]. It underpins reliability in [[dec-live-vs-standard-vs-priority]].

## Gotchas / limits
- Retryable (re-set after a delay): 40103, 40601, 40602, 50301, 50303, 50401, 50402. For a single 50401 timeout, retry the same payload; for widespread failures, pause 5-10 min.
- Not retryable until you fix the cause: auth (40100, 40104), billing (40200, 40210), validation (40501-40506), not-found (40400-40408).
- A task returning an error is not processed further; you must re-set it.
- 40403 means results aged past the 30-day window - re-run the task. See [[cap-account-usage-userdata]].
- Failed pingbacks/postbacks can be re-sent via the Webhook Resend endpoint. See [[cap-webhooks-pingback-postback]].

- 40202 maps to the 2000 calls/min ceiling; 40209 to the 30-simultaneous cap. See [[cap-rate-limits-throughput]].
- 40204 stays in the code catalog as "subscription required," but it is legacy for the historically gated Backlinks and LLM Mentions modules. A pay-as-you-go account no longer receives 40204 for those modules after the 2026-07-01 move; if it appears elsewhere, handle it as a product-specific access error. See [[cap-backlinks-api]] and [[cap-llm-mentions-visibility]].
- **Docs conflict (verified 2026-09-16):** the official errors appendix still describes 40204 as "access denied. visit plans and subscriptions to activate your subscription and get access to this api" and still names the Backlinks API. That page has not been updated since the 2026-07-01 pay-as-you-go move. A live `backlinks/summary/live` call on a pay-as-you-go account with no subscription returned `status_code: 20000` on 2026-09-16. Trust the live probe over the appendix text.
- 40505 ("Outdated location parameters") fails geo-targeted tasks; refresh from the helper endpoint. See [[cap-locations-languages-targeting]].
- 40404 ("Sandbox missing prepared data") only occurs in the sandbox environment. See [[cap-sandbox-testing]].
- 50401 is the Live 120-second timeout; 50402 is the 50-second target-page cap. See [[cap-task-vs-live-execution]].
- 40006 caps a POST at 100 tasks; special endpoints cap at 20. See [[cap-rate-limits-throughput]].
- 40601 ("Task Handed") and 40602 ("Task in Queue") are transient Standard states, not failures.
- General rule: 50xxx server errors retry in a few minutes; input-validation errors require fixing the payload.
- Whitelisting issues surface as 40207 when IP whitelisting is enabled. See [[cap-authentication-security]].
- Build the retry matrix into [[play-cost-optimized-pipeline]] and [[dec-cost-control-strategy]].
