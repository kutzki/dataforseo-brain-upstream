# LLM Mentions and Visibility

> Structured data on where brands, domains, and keywords are mentioned and cited inside AI answers. Sits under [[index|DataForSEO Brain]] -> [[concepts/_index|Concepts]].

> **Cost and targeting (2026-10-02):** every LLM Mentions call is **$0.10 flat** + $0.001/row. Put several targets in one `multi_target_metrics` call. Query-side endpoints need KEYWORD targets; domain targets return zeros, fully billed. 52 exploratory calls cost ~$5.27 in September 2026.

## Overview
The LLM Mentions API (launched 2025-11-11) is DataForSEO's flagship AI-visibility tracker. It answers the question traditional SEO tools cannot: is my brand named, and is my site cited, inside generative AI answers. It maintains a mentions database collected from Google AI Overview and ChatGPT, each mention being a question-answer pair plus the sources the model cited. It is the measurement half of GEO, paired with the live-querying endpoints in [[cap-ai-optimization-api]]. All five endpoints are Live-only under `/v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/`.

## What it covers

> ### v1 -> v2 migration (2026-09-17)
>
> The five v1 endpoints below are **retired upstream**: absent from the official
> OpenAPI spec, and the generated clients expose no callable method for them.
> They remain billable, so calls still succeed - which is exactly why this is
> easy to miss. **Do not build new work on v1.**
>
> | v1 (retired) | v2 replacement | Shape change |
> |---|---|---|
> | `search/live` | `search_mentions/live` | `target` object -> **array** of up to 10 entities |
> | `top_domains/live` | `top_mentioned_domains/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `top_pages/live` | `top_mentioned_pages/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `aggregated_metrics/live` | `target_metrics/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `cross_aggregated_metrics/live` | `multi_target_metrics/live` | - |
>
> v2 also adds `top_mentioned_brands`, `top_mentioned_brand_categories`,
> `historical`, `timeseries_delta` and `timeseries_new_lost` with no v1
> equivalent. `_lite` variants cost the same - they reduce response size, not
> spend. Evidence: [[dfs-github-org-sweep]], [[dfs-openapi-spec]].

- **Search** (`/llm_mentions/search/live`) - **RETIRED, use `search_mentions/live`**: raw mention records for target keywords/domains, returning `question`, `answer` (markdown), `sources[]`, `search_results[]`, `ai_search_volume`, `monthly_searches[]`, `brand_entities[]`, and `fan_out_queries[]`.
- **Top Pages** (`/llm_mentions/top_pages/live`) - **RETIRED, use `top_mentioned_pages/live`**: mentions metrics grouped by the most-cited pages for a target.
- **Top Domains** (`/llm_mentions/top_domains/live`) - **RETIRED, use `top_mentioned_domains/live`**: mentions metrics grouped by the most-cited domains.
- **Aggregated Metrics** (`/llm_mentions/aggregated_metrics/live`) - **RETIRED, use `target_metrics/live`**: consolidated metrics for one target across location, language, platform, and source domain.
- **Cross Aggregated Metrics** (`/llm_mentions/cross_aggregated_metrics/live`) - **RETIRED, use `multi_target_metrics/live`**: the same metrics for 2-10 targets at once, labelled by `aggregation_key`, for side-by-side brand or keyword comparison. Note the task spec slug `cross_model_comparison` maps to this real path.
- Aggregation endpoints accept `initial_dataset_filters` with operators `=`, `<>`, `in`, `not_in`, `like`, `not_like`, `ilike`, `not_ilike`, `match`, `not_match`, applied before grouping.
- `links_scope` (sources or search_results) on Top Pages and Top Domains controls whether grouping uses cited sources or retrieved search results.

## Key parameters / inputs
| field | notes |
|---|---|
| target | array of up to 10 entities, each a domain or a keyword |
| domain | entity; <= 63 chars; no https:// or www; `include_subdomains` optional |
| keyword | entity; <= 250 chars; `match_type` word_match or partial_match |
| search_filter | include or exclude (default include) |
| search_scope | domain: any/sources/search_results; keyword: any/question/answer/brand_entities/fan_out_queries |
| platform | chat_gpt or google (default google; model then always google_ai_overview) |
| location_* / language_* | default 2840 (US) / en; ChatGPT is US/English only |
| initial_dataset_filters | up to 8 filter expressions applied before aggregation |
| targets / aggregation_key | Cross Aggregated only; 2-10 targets, key labels each group |

## Response / what you get back
Search returns `total_count`, `current_offset`, `search_after_token`, and `items[]`. Each item carries `platform`, `model_name`, `question`, `answer`, `sources[]` (source_name, snippet, title, domain, url, position, publication_date), `search_results[]`, `ai_search_volume`, `first_response_at`, `last_response_at`, and `brand_entities[]`. The aggregation endpoints return a `total` object plus grouped arrays: `location[]`, `language[]`, `platform[]`, `sources_domain[]`, `search_results_domain[]`, `brand_entities_title[]`, `brand_entities_category[]`. Group elements carry `key`, `mentions`, and `ai_search_volume` (note `impressions` is deprecated and returns null).

## Cost & method notes
- Per the AI Optimization page, LLM Mentions is pay-as-you-go: roughly $0.10 per request plus $0.001 per row, about $1.10 per 1,000 rows, with no monthly minimum since DataForSEO's 2026-07-01 pricing update.
- All endpoints are Live-only with one task per call. See [[cap-queue-priority-cost-model]] and [[cap-task-vs-live-execution]].

## When to use / how it fits
LLM Mentions is the data engine of [[play-ai-visibility-tracking]] and the GEO loop in [[cap-geo-ai-search-optimization]]. Use Search for evidence (the actual question and answer), Top Domains/Pages to see who AI cites in your category, and Cross Aggregated Metrics to compute Share of Voice across competitors. Practitioner research notes that about 85% of brand mentions come from third-party pages, so the off-domain `sources_domain[]` view matters as much as your own. The answer surfaces are profiled in [[plat-ai-assistants]] and the models in [[ent-llm-model-providers]].

## LLM Mentions v2 endpoint family (verified live 2026-09-17)

The five endpoints documented above are the original set. The account exposes
**20**. The v2 family below was missing from this note until 2026-09-17 and is
the part that matters for productised AI-visibility work.

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `target_metrics/live` | mentions + ai_search_volume for up to **10 entities** (domains and/or keywords) in one target set |
| `multi_target_metrics/live` | the same, for **2-10 labelled target sets** - client vs competitor set in a single call |
| `search_mentions/live` | mention-level search |
| `top_mentioned_brands/live` | brand-level share of voice in LLM answers |
| `top_mentioned_brand_categories/live` | category-level share of voice |
| `top_mentioned_domains/live` | newer counterpart to `top_domains` |
| `top_mentioned_pages/live` | newer counterpart to `top_pages` |
| `historical/live` | backfill for trend baselines |
| `timeseries_delta/live` | change in mentions between periods |
| `timeseries_new_lost/live` | mentions gained and lost |

`_lite` variants exist for `target_metrics`, `top_mentioned_domains`,
`top_mentioned_pages`, `top_mentioned_brands` and `top_mentioned_brand_categories`.

### Billing - the lever that matters
**A task is one billable request regardless of how many targets it carries.**
Verified live 2026-09-17: `multi_target_metrics` with 5 domains cost **$0.105**
($0.10 request + $0.001 x 5 results). Five separate `target_metrics` calls would
have cost about **$0.505** - roughly **4.8x** more for identical data.

**`_lite` is NOT cheaper.** Every LLM Mentions endpoint, lite included, bills
$0.10/request + $0.001/result. Choose lite for a smaller response, never for spend.

### Request shape (both endpoints)
- `target_metrics`: `target` array, up to 10 entities. Each is either
  `{"domain": ..., "search_filter": "include|exclude", "search_scope": "any|sources|search_results"}`
  or `{"keyword": ..., "match_type": "word_match|partial_match"}`.
  At least one entity must be `"search_filter": "include"`.
- `multi_target_metrics`: `targets` array of 2-10 objects, each
  `{"key": "<label, <=250 chars>", "target": [ ...entities... ]}`.
- Optional on both: `location_code` (default 2840 US), `language_code` (default
  `en`), `platform` (`chat_gpt` | `google`; both if omitted),
  `initial_dataset_filters` (max 8), `internal_list_limit` (1-10), `tag`.
- Live method only. **Post to the bare path - no trailing slash.**

### Worked result (client.example competitor set, location_code 2124, 2026-09-17)
| Target | mentions | ai_search_volume |
|---|---|---|
| client.example | 1 | 70 |
| competitor-a.example | 338 | 111,870 |
| competitor-b.example | 13 | 1,160 |
| competitor-c.example | 99 | 35,860 |
| competitor-d.example | 670 | 167,440 |

One $0.105 call reproduced figures an earlier audit assembled by
hand. See [[play-ai-visibility-tracker]].

## Gotchas / limits
- Access is now plain pay-as-you-go, with no subscription or activation step. It returned `40204` through 2026-06-26; that gate was removed 2026-07-01 when DataForSEO moved all APIs to pay-as-you-go. A live re-probe on 2026-07-08 returned `20000 Ok` with real data for `/v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/search/live`; fixture: `.raw/sources/dataforseo-research/ai-optimization/fixtures/llm-mentions-search.json`. See [[cap-status-error-codes]].
- ChatGPT coverage uses model GPT-5 and covers United States (location_code 2840) and English only; Google AI Overview (`model_name` always `google_ai_overview`) supports multiple locations and languages and is the broad-coverage platform. The launch announcement notes initial coverage is narrower than the marketing list.
- Execution up to 120 seconds; 2000 calls/min; one task per call; `offset` max 9,000 (use `search_after_token` beyond 20,000 results).
- Citation churn is high (industry studies report 40-60% of cited sources change month to month), so trends matter more than any single snapshot. See [[cap-data-collection-methodology]].
- For the `google` platform the `model_name` is always `google_ai_overview`; there is no per-Gemini-version selection here, unlike LLM Responses.
- `impressions` is deprecated and returns null across all aggregation endpoints, so do not build metrics on it.
