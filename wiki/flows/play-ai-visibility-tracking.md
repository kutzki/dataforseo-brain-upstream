# Play: AI Visibility Tracking

> The GEO loop: measure brand mentions/citations inside AI answers with LLM Mentions, sample fresh model answers with LLM Responses, and roll it into a share-of-voice dashboard. Sits under [[index|DataForSEO Brain]] -> [[flows/_index|Flows]].

## Overview
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) tracks whether a brand is named, cited, or recommended inside AI answers rather than ranked in blue links. This flow has two engines: the LLM Mentions API (a pre-indexed mentions/citations database with its own AI search-volume index) for aggregated visibility, and LLM Responses (live model querying across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) for fresh prompt sampling. Together they give a repeatable AI-era rank tracker.

## Trigger
A brand wants to know how it shows up in AI answers: a GEO program launch, a competitive share-of-voice study, or monitoring after a content push. Inputs are target entities (brand domain and/or keywords) and a prompt set of real buyer questions.

## Endpoints used (in order)

> ### v1 -> v2 migration (2026-09-17)
>
> The five v1 endpoints below are **retired upstream**: absent from the official
> OpenAPI spec, and the generated clients expose no callable method for them.
> They remain billable, so calls still succeed - which is exactly why this is
> easy to miss. **Do not build new work on v1.**
>
> | v1 (retired) | v2 replacement | Shape change |
> |---|---|---|
> | `search/live` | `search_mentions/live` | `target` object -> **array** of up to 10 entities |
> | `top_domains/live` | `top_mentioned_domains/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `top_pages/live` | `top_mentioned_pages/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `aggregated_metrics/live` | `target_metrics/live` (+ `_lite`) | - |
> | `cross_aggregated_metrics/live` | `multi_target_metrics/live` | - |
>
> v2 also adds `top_mentioned_brands`, `top_mentioned_brand_categories`,
> `historical`, `timeseries_delta` and `timeseries_new_lost` with no v1
> equivalent. `_lite` variants cost the same - they reduce response size, not
> spend. Evidence: [[dfs-github-org-sweep]], [[dfs-openapi-spec]].

- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/search_mentions/live` (raw mention records; `target` is an array).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/target_metrics/live` (consolidated metrics for one target).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/multi_target_metrics/live` (2-10 targets in ONE billed request - the default for client-vs-competitor work).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/top_mentioned_domains/live` and `/top_mentioned_pages/live` (most-cited sources).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/timeseries_delta/live` (change over time - turns a one-off audit into tracking).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/{chat_gpt|claude|gemini|perplexity}/llm_responses/live` (live answer sampling).
- `POST /v3/ai_optimization/ai_keyword_data/keywords_search_volume/live` (AI search volume).

## Pipeline
1. Define targets: build the `target` array (up to 10 entities) of domains (`domain`, `search_filter`, `search_scope` sources/search_results) and keywords (`keyword`, `match_type`, `search_scope` question/answer/brand_entities). Set `platform` (`google` for AI Overview, `chat_gpt`) plus `location_code`/`language_code`.
2. Pull mentions with `llm_mentions/search_mentions` (note: `target` is an array of up to 10 entities): each item returns the `question`, the `answer` (markdown), cited `sources[]` (title, url, domain, position), `search_results[]`, `brand_entities[]`, `fan_out_queries[]`, and `ai_search_volume` with `monthly_searches[]`.
3. Aggregate visibility with `aggregated_metrics` (mentions + ai_search_volume grouped by location/language/platform/source domain) and compute share of voice = your mentions / total tracked-brand mentions.
4. Benchmark competitors with `cross_aggregated_metrics`: supply 2-10 `targets` each with an `aggregation_key` label to get side-by-side group totals in one call.
5. Find citation surfaces with `top_domains`/`top_pages` to see which domains and pages the models cite for your topic (often third-party/UGC, not your own site).
6. Sample fresh answers with `llm_responses`: send the same prompt set across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity (`user_prompt` <=500 chars, choose `model_name`, set `web_search: true` to force current citations) and parse `items[]` message `sections[]` and `annotations[]` for mention presence and sentiment.
7. Score and chart: per engine, record mention rate, citation rate, share of voice, position, and sentiment over time; alert on drops.

## Cost & cadence
- LLM Mentions is Live-only and pay-as-you-go, priced about $0.10/request + $0.001/row, roughly $1.10 per 1,000 rows; turnaround about 2 seconds. It returned `40204` through 2026-06-26, then the subscription and activation step were removed on 2026-07-01. A 2026-07-08 re-probe of `/v3/ai_optimization/llm_mentions/search/live` returned `20000 Ok` with real data; fixture: `.raw/sources/dataforseo-research/ai-optimization/fixtures/llm-mentions-search.json`.
- LLM Responses bills DataForSEO's per-task cost (about $0.0006/task) plus a pass-through `money_spent` for the underlying model tokens. AI Keyword Data bills about $0.0101/task (cost-log: $0.0101).
- Cadence: mentions/aggregates weekly or monthly (the data has churn but stable patterns); live prompt sampling weekly across the model set.

## Output
An AI visibility dashboard per engine: mention rate, citation rate, AI share of voice, sentiment, the most-cited source domains/pages, and the fan-out queries driving answers. Pairs with [[play-content-strategy-brief]] to act on citation gaps.

## Pitfalls / limits
- Coverage is narrower than the headline: ChatGPT mentions data is US (`location_code 2840`) and English only; Google AI Overview supports multiple locations/languages.
- `impressions` is deprecated and returns null; do not build on it.
- LLM Responses `annotations[]` can be empty even when `web_search: true`, and `web_search` is unsupported on some reasoning models (o1, o3-mini); validate per model.
- Most brand validation is off-domain (third-party pages), so track earned/UGC sources, not just your own site.
- Track each engine separately; cross-engine citation overlap is low, so a single blended number hides the real picture.

## Decisions in play
- [[dec-which-api-for-which-job]]: LLM Mentions for aggregated brand/citation visibility; LLM Responses for fresh, controllable prompt sampling across models.
- [[dec-cost-control-strategy]]: LLM Mentions bills per request and per row, so design a fixed prompt/target set and cache; LLM Responses adds a pass-through `money_spent` token charge per model.
- [[dec-dataforseo-vs-ahrefs-semrush-moz]]: DataForSEO is raw GEO infrastructure, not a finished SOV dashboard; you build the scoring and charts.
